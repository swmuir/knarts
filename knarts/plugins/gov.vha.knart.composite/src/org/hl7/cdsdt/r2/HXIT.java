 * Information about the history of this value: period of validity and a reference to an identified event that established this value as valid.
 * 
 * Because of the way that the types are defined, a number of attributes of the datatypes have values with a type derived from HXIT. In these cases the HXIT attributes are constrained to null. The only case where the HXIT attributes are allowed within a datatype is on items in a collection (DSET, LIST, BAG, HIST).
 * The use of these attributes is generally subject to further constraints in the specifications that make use of these types.
 * 
 * This class is maintained here despite the lack of attributes to maintain compatibility with the ISO 21090 data structure.
